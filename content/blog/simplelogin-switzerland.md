In 2022, [SimpleLogin joined forces with Proton](https://proton.me/blog/proton-and-simplelogin-join-forces), allowing us to benefit from Proton's infrastructure, deliverability, and anti-abuse expertise to make SimpleLogin better. However, one of the few things that didn't change was SimpleLogin's legal domicile, which today remains in France, as SimpleLogin SAS is based in Paris.

In recent months, after a deeper legal analysis, we have decided to move SimpleLogin's legal domicile to [Switzerland](https://proton.me/blog/switzerland), the home country of Proton, to take advantage of the stronger privacy protections that Swiss law provides. This change will take place on January 1, 2024, and we will update SimpleLogin's [Terms of Service](/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) so that the contractual relationship between SimpleLogin and SimpleLogin users will now be through Proton AG (Switzerland).

### What this means for the SimpleLogin community


Nothing about the service you receive will change. The app, the payments, everything will remain the same. The only changes are:

-   Data requests from law enforcement must now go through the Swiss legal system and meet the high thresholds laid out in Swiss law before they can be acted upon.

-   By switching to Swiss law, SimpleLogin will no longer face the potential obligation to implement France's data retention policies.

We believe both of these changes will contribute to better privacy protection for the SimpleLogin community. Thank you again for your support and encouragement. We look forward to continuing to deliver even more benefits to SimpleLogin users in 2024.
